The framework can be applied in IoT environments supporting solutions in various domains (e.g., Industrial, Cybersecurity, etch.). For example, the solution may be used to collect security related data (e.g., network, system, solution proprietary, etch.) from monitored IoT systems and store them to detect patterns of abnormal behaviour by applying simple (i.e., filtering and pre-processing) or more elaborated mechanisms (i.e., AI algorithms). The design of the framework is driven by configurability, extensibility, dynamic setup, stream handling capabilities and Blockchain (Ledger) support. One of the key features of the framework is that it is detached from the underlying infrastructure by employing a specialized data model for modelling the solution’s Data Sources, Processors and Results which facilitates the data interoperability discoverability and configurability of the offered solution.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Jekyll!</title><link href="/jekyll/update/2024/10/19/welcome-to-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Jekyll!" /><published>2024-10-19T22:00:03+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-19T22:00:03+00:00</updated><id>/jekyll/update/2024/10/19/welcome-to-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="/jekyll/update/2024/10/19/welcome-to-jekyll.html"><![CDATA[<p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
