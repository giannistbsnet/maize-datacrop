# Getting Started

Before using the Workflow Editor, choose a deployment path on the [Maize Setup](/Setup/) page: either the single-script Maize MVP approach or the manual per-repository setup.

Available processors depend on your deployment; administrators can ship predefined processor definitions during deployment (see [Model Repository Setup](/model-repo/)).

## Accessing the Workflow Editor

To access the Workflow Editor, you need to log in using **Keycloak**. You can authenticate in one of two ways:

1. Using credentials you already have.
2. Using **Single Sign-On (SSO)** with your GitHub account.
