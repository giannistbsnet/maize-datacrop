# Manual per-repository setup

Use this path if you want to deploy and customize each component separately. Follow the component pages in order:

1. [Keycloak Setup](/keycloak/)
2. [Airflow Setup](/airflow/)
3. [Worker Setup](/worker/)
4. [Model Repository Setup](/model-repo/)
5. [Workflow Editor Setup](/editor/)

You can still reference these pages even if you use the Maize MVP path, to understand variables and configuration details.
