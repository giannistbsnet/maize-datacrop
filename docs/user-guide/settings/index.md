# Settings

The Settings page controls user-level preferences, registry credentials, and admin resource initialization.

## Sections Overview

Current sections in the UI:

1. **Appearance & Theme**
2. **Application Preferences**
3. **Initialize Resources** (admin only card inside Application Preferences)
4. **Registry Credentials**
5. **Save Settings**
6. **User Profile**

## Appearance & Theme

### Theme Mode

- Toggle between light and dark mode.
- The toggle updates user store dark-theme state used by the app theme.

### Primary Color

- Select from predefined color swatches.
- Color is applied immediately to Vuetify custom light/dark themes.
- Change is saved locally immediately; server persistence happens only when pressing **Save**.

## Application Preferences

### Start Page

- UI shows a Start Page selector (Warehouse/Lab/Airflow/Kibana).
- In current implementation it is **disabled** and labeled **Coming Soon**.
- Effective behavior remains fixed to Warehouse as default landing page.

### Initialize Resources (Admin Only)

- Visible only when user is detected as admin.
- Button calls backend `POST /user/v1/initialize-resources`.
- Intended impact from frontend perspective:
  - initializes required catalogs/resources used by Warehouse/Lab (for example worker category dependency checked by inventory initialization).
- Action is repeatable from UI.

## Registry Credentials

This section manages private image registry credentials used by backend runtime configuration.

### What You Can Do

- Add registry credentials.
- Edit existing entry.
- Remove entry.

### Supported Presets

- Docker Hub (`docker.io`)
- GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`)
- GitLab (`registry.gitlab.com`)
- Custom registry URL

### Current Form Rules

- Required: normalized URL + username.
- Token rules:
  - New entry requires token/password.
  - Editing an entry with stored token: token field can be left blank to keep stored secret.
- URL normalization removes protocol (`http://`, `https://`) and trailing slashes.

### Token Handling Behavior

- Stored token is masked in UI (`********`).
- Existing token value is not shown back to users.

## Save Settings

- **Save** button persists settings to backend via `POST /user/v1/settings`.
- On success: success notification and local backup update.
- On backend failure: error notification and fallback save to localStorage still occurs.

Saved data payload includes:

- selected color
- landing page value (currently not functionally used for startup routing)
- registry credentials payload

## User Profile

Displays read-only account data from user/auth stores (populated from decoded Keycloak token fields):

- full name
- authority
- admin flag
- email
- username
- region
- user id
- roles

In-app profile editing is not implemented.

## Troubleshooting

- **Initialize button not visible**: account is not recognized as admin.
- **Save fails to backend**: settings still fall back to localStorage; check backend availability/auth token.
- **Cannot save registry entry**: ensure URL and username are set; set token when creating new entry.
- **Theme color not persisted after reload**: use **Save** to persist to backend (local fallback depends on browser storage state).
