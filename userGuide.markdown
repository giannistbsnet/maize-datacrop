# DataCROP Maize Workflow Management Engine User Guide

## Overview

The Workflow Management Engine application is designed to facilitate efficient creation and management of workflows through four primary tabs in the sidebar: **Warehouse**, **Lab**, **Airflow**, and **Kibana**. Each tab serves a distinct purpose within the application.

- **Warehouse**: A repository for creating and managing the data models that are used in workflows.
- **Lab**: A dedicated space for designing and configuring workflows, leveraging the data models from the Warehouse.
- **Airflow**: For monitoring the deployment of components.
- **Kibana**: For data visualization.
